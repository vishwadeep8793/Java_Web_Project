The first Shopify store was our own.<br>
It's been our mission to make commerce better for everyone ever since. <br>
Just over a decade ago we started an online store to sell snowboard equipment directly to those who loved the sport as much as us.

We could have listed our products on a number of marketplaces, but we wanted to own our brand and build relationships with our customers, along with selling our goods. Such a tool didn't exist, so we built it for ourselves. We soon realized a number of other stores were in need of a hassle-free platform to build their retail business, and Shopify was born.

We focus on making commerce better for everyone, so businesses can focus on what they do best: building and selling their products. Today, merchants use our platform to manage every aspect of their business - from products to orders to customers, selling online, in retail stores, and on the go.
